    <h1>What is Internet</h1>
<b>How does it work</b>
<p>The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard <em>Internet protocol suite</em> (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of millions of <em>private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope,</em> linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the <em>World Wide Web</em> (WWW), the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony.</p>
